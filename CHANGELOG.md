All notable changes to Lightly**Train** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- DINOv2 pre-trained models with registers to supported models.
- Pretraining allows now custom filenames for checkpoints.

### Changed

- Patch embedding in ViT to support image resolution that is not a multiple of the patch size.
- Augmentations plotting function to support odd-sized images.
- DistillationV2 to work with image resolution that is not a multiple of the patch size.
- DINOv2 model without registers names changed from `dinov2_vit/vits14` to `dinov2_vit/vits14-noreg`.
- DINOv2 model with registers are named `dinov2_vit/vits14-pretrained` (for example).
- DINOv2 model names changed from `dinov2_vit/vits14_pretrain` to `dinov2/vits14-pretrained`
  to make the naming more consistent. Old names are still supported but will be removed
  in a future release.
- Default teacher name in distillation methods.

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-21

### Added

- Add an extra `teacher_weights` argument in `method_args` to allow loading pretrained DINOv2 teacher weights for distillation methods.
- Add support for allowing images with different number of channels in the channel drop transform.
- Add documentation for the [RT-DETRv2 models](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/models/rtdetr.html).
- Add warning for situations where the number of steps is below the recommendation for DINOv2.

### Changed

- The callback `DeviceStatsMonitor` is now disabled by default.
- Replace epoch-based warmup hyperparameters with iteration-based ones.

### Removed

- Remove a note and specific recommendation for using DINOv2 with pretrained weights in the documentation.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-06-23

### Added

- Add `student_freeze_backbone_epochs` option to DINOv2 method to control how many epochs
  the student backbone is frozen during training. We suggest setting it to 1 when
  starting from DINOv2 pretrained weights. See the [DINOv2 documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/methods/dinov2.html)
  for more information.
- Add channel drop transform.
- Add option to load multi-channel images with `LIGHTLY_TRAIN_IMAGE_MODE="UNCHANGED"`.
- Add option to reuse memmap dataset file via environment variable: `LIGHTLY_TRAIN_MMAP_REUSE_FILE=True`.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-06-10

### Added

- **DINOv2 pretraining is now available** with the `method="dinov2"` argument.
  The method is in beta and further improvements will be released in the coming weeks.
  See the [DINOv2 documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/methods/dinov2.html)
  for more information.
- Support for [Torchvision ShuffleNetV2 models](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/models/torchvision.html).
- [RT-DETR](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/models/rtdetr.html) has now an
  integrated model wrapper.

### Changed

- The [Ultralytics YOLO tutorial](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/tutorials/yolo/index.html)
  now highlights better how to use YOLO with LightlyTrain.

### Deprecated

- The `resume` parameter in the `train` command is deprecated in favor of
  `resume_interrupted` and will be removed in a future release. The new parameter
  behaves the same as the old one but is more explicit about its purpose. See
  [the documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/train/index.html#resume-training)
  for more information.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-05-26

- Add MLflow logger to enable system and model metric logging.
- Add support for lists of files and folders as input to the `embed` and `train` commands.
- Add faster dataset initialization (SLURM and Windows).
